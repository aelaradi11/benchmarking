Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n        1. **Understanding the Question:**\n           - The question asks for Quranic verses that discuss individuals who were given a portion of the Scripture and chose error over guidance.\n           - This implies looking for verses that describe people who were blessed with knowledge or guidance but instead chose to follow incorrect paths.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Surahs:**\n   - **Al-Baqarah (2:255):**\n     - This verse mentions that those who were given the Scripture and chose error over guidance are those who have been given the Book and yet have not been guided.\n     - It highlights the responsibility of those who have been blessed with knowledge or guidance to use it wisely.\n     - **Relevance Score: 10**\n\n   - **Al-A'raf (7:113):**\n     - This verse describes the people who were given the Scripture and yet did not follow the right path.\n     - It emphasizes the importance of following the guidance provided and the consequences of not doing so.\n     - **Relevance Score: 9**\n\n3. **Selecting Additional Relevant Verses:**\n   - **Al-Baqarah (2:142):**\n     - This verse mentions that those who were given the Scripture and yet did not follow the right path are those who have been given the Book and yet have not been guided.\n     - It reinforces the idea of responsibility and the consequences of not using guidance wisely.\n     - **Relevance Score: 8**\n\n   - **Al-A'raf (7:179):**\n     - This verse describes the people who were given the Scripture and yet did not follow the right path.\n     - It emphasizes the importance of following the guidance provided and the consequences of not doing so.\n     - **Relevance Score: 7**\n\n   - **Al-Baqarah (2:173):**\n     - This verse mentions that those who were given the Scripture and yet did not follow the right path are those who have been given the Book and yet have not been guided.\n     - It highlights the responsibility of those who have been blessed with knowledge or guidance to use it wisely.\n     - **Relevance Score: 6**\n\n4. **Finalizing the List:**\n   - The top 5 most relevant verses are:\n     1. **Al-Baqarah (2:255)**\n     2. **Al-A'raf (7:113)**\n     3. **Al-Baqarah (2:142)**\n     4. **Al-A'raf (7:179)**\n     5. **Al-Baqarah (2:173)**\n\n5. **Formatting the Answer:**\n   - The answer is presented in the required JSON format:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"verses\": [\n         {\n           \"surah_name_format\": \"Al-Baqarah:255\",\n           \"surah_number_format\": \"2:255\",\n           \"relevance_score\": 10\n         },\n         {\n           \"surah_name_format\": \"Al-A'raf:113\",\n           \"surah_number_format\": \"7:113\",\n           \"relevance_score\": 9\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n     This format includes the Surah name and number in both formats, along with the relevance score, ordered from highest to lowest.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n{\n\"verses\": [\n{\n\"surah_name_format\": \"Al-Baqarah:255\",\n\"surah_number_format\": \"2:255\",\n\"relevance_score\": 10\n},\n{\n\"surah_name_format\": \"Al-A'raf:113\",\n\"surah_number_format\": \"7:113\",\n\"relevance_score\": 9\n}\n]\n}",

The following verses are relevant to this theme:\n\n        1. **Al-Baqarah:255**\n           - \"And when it is said to them, 'Do not spread confusion among the people,' they do not cease. They do not obey. They are in a state of disbelief. So We will destroy them with a terrible destruction.\" (Quran 2:255)\n           - This verse highlights the behavior of those who refuse to heed warnings and instead spread confusion and mislead others.\n\n        2. **Al-A'raf:113**\n           - \"And when it is said to them, 'Do not spread confusion among the people,' they do not cease. They do not obey. They are in a state of disbelief. So We will destroy them with a terrible destruction.\" (Quran 7:113)\n           - This verse is identical to Al-Baqarah:255, emphasizing the same point about the behavior of those who refuse to obey and spread confusion.\n\n        3. **Al-Baqarah:256**\n           - \"And when it is said to them, 'Do not spread confusion among the people,' they do not cease.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning to identify the relevant Quranic verses:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**\n   - The question asks about the Quranic verse(s) that discuss the hardening of hearts and the influence of Satan during the time of punishment.\n   - This implies looking for verses that describe how Satan affects people's hearts, especially during times of punishment or adversity.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Surahs:**\n   - **Al-Baqarah (2:255):**\n     - This verse mentions that Satan will be cast into the fire and will be tormented, but it also mentions that he will be able to tempt people's hearts.\n     - The verse reads: \"And Satan will be to them a whispering, whispering among them from of old, so that they may take for themselves things they have not earned. And indeed, Satan is to man an open enemy.\"\n     - This verse directly addresses the influence of Satan on people's hearts, making it highly relevant.\n\n   - **Al-A'raf (7:113):**\n     - This verse mentions that Satan will be cast into the fire and will be tormented, but it also mentions that he will be able to tempt people's hearts.\n     - The verse reads: \"And Satan will be to them a whispering, whispering among them from of old, so that they may take for themselves things they have not earned.\"\n     - Similar to Al-Baqarah, this verse also discusses Satan's influence on people's hearts, making it relevant.\n\n3. **Assessing Relevance Scores:**\n   - Both Al-Baqarah and Al-A'raf have similar themes and messages regarding Satan's influence on people's hearts.\n   - Given the direct mention of Satan's whispering and tempting people's hearts, both verses are highly relevant.\n   - However, Al-Baqarah is slightly more specific about Satan's role and the consequences of his actions, which might make it slightly more relevant.\n\n4. **Finalizing the Answer:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the two most relevant verses are Al-Baqarah:255 and Al-A'raf:113.\n   - These verses both discuss the hardening of hearts and the influence of Satan during the time of punishment, making them the most relevant answers.\n\n5. **Formatting the Answer:**\n   - The answer is presented in the required JSON format, with the surah name and number formats, relevance scores, and the verses themselves.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n{\n  \"verses\": [\n    {\n      \"surah_name_format\": \"Al-Baqarah:255\",\n      \"surah_number_format\": \"2:255\",\n      \"relevance_score\": 10\n    },\n    {\n      \"surah_name_format\": \"Al-A'raf:113\",\n      \"surah_number_format\": \"7:113\",\n      \"relevance_score\": 9\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n        1. **Understanding the Question:**\n           - The question asks for Quranic verses that illustrate the consequences of hardening one's heart in the face of divine punishment.\n           - This implies looking for verses that describe the negative outcomes or reactions of individuals who refuse to accept or comply with divine commands.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Surahs:**\n   - **Al-Baqarah (2:255):**\n     - This verse is part of the second chapter of the Quran and is known for its emphasis on the consequences of hardening one's heart.\n     - The verse states: \"And We have certainly honored the children of Adam. And We have provided them with adornment and appointed them in the earth in every place. And We have preferred them over many of those who came before them, and We have given them preference over them. And to them We have given the Book, which We have made a blessing and a guidance. And to them We have given the bounty, and to them We have given the knowledge. But they turn away with their hearts, and their ears are closed, and the blind ones are the ones who are astray. And We have certainly made some of them as a test for others. And We have made them as vassals of the Fire, and We have not given them any authority over the earth, nor a share in the leadership. And We have certainly made them as a test for the others. And We have not sent them except as a mercy. But the disbelievers among them are the ones who will be punished.\"\n   - This verse highlights the consequences of hardening one's heart, including being turned away from divine blessings, being blind to the truth, and facing punishment.\n\n3. **Al-A'raf (7:113):**\n   - This verse is part of the seventh chapter of the Quran and also deals with the consequences of hardening one's heart.\n   - The verse states: \"And We have certainly honored the children of Adam. And We have provided them with adornment and appointed them in the earth in every place. And We have preferred them over many of those who came before them, and We have given them preference over them. And to them We have given the Book, which We have made a blessing and a guidance. And to them We have given the bounty, and to them We have given the knowledge. But they turn away with their hearts, and their ears are closed, and the blind ones are the ones who are astray. And We have certainly made some of them as a test for others. And We have made them as vassals of the Fire, and We have not given them any authority over the earth, nor a share in the leadership. And We have certainly made them as a test for the others. And We have not sent them except as a mercy. But the disbelievers among them are the ones who will be punished.\"\n   - This verse is identical to Al-Baqarah (2:255), reinforcing the idea that hardening one's heart leads to negative consequences.\n\n4. **Other Relevant Surahs:**\n   - **Al-Nisa (4:54):**\n     - This verse discusses the consequences of rejecting divine guidance and the importance of following the right path.\n     - The verse states: \"O you who have believed, be persisting in righteousness. Obey Allah and the Messenger and the people of knowledge among you, and do not be a party to the ignorant.\"\n   - While not directly addressing hardening one's heart, this verse emphasizes the importance of following divine guidance and the consequences of rejecting it.\n\n5. **Al-Kahf (18:104):**\n   - This verse describes the story of the people of the cave and their rejection of divine guidance.\n   - The verse states: \"And We had certainly tested them with a great test. And they said, 'We have believed in Allah, and in the promise of the Messiah.' But the Messiah said, 'I have not received anything from Allah except what I received from the ones who were with me. So they did desecrate me after I had come to them, and they did not accept guidance. They said, 'He is the Messiah, the Christ.' But they",
