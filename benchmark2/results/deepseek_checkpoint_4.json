Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n        1. **Understanding the Question:**\n           - The question asks for Quranic verses that discuss individuals who were given a portion of the Scripture and chose error over guidance.\n           - This implies looking for verses that describe people who were blessed with knowledge or guidance but instead chose to follow incorrect paths.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Surahs:**\n   - **Al-Baqarah (2:255):**\n     - This verse mentions that those who were given the Scripture and chose error over guidance are those who have been given the Book and yet have not been guided.\n     - It highlights the responsibility of those who have been blessed with knowledge or guidance to use it wisely.\n     - **Relevance Score: 10**\n\n   - **Al-A'raf (7:113):**\n     - This verse describes the people who were given the Scripture and yet did not follow the right path.\n     - It emphasizes the importance of following the guidance provided and the consequences of not doing so.\n     - **Relevance Score: 9**\n\n3. **Selecting Additional Relevant Verses:**\n   - **Al-Baqarah (2:142):**\n     - This verse mentions that those who were given the Scripture and yet did not follow the right path are those who have been given the Book and yet have not been guided.\n     - It reinforces the idea of responsibility and the consequences of not using guidance wisely.\n     - **Relevance Score: 8**\n\n   - **Al-A'raf (7:179):**\n     - This verse describes the people who were given the Scripture and yet did not follow the right path.\n     - It emphasizes the importance of following the guidance provided and the consequences of not doing so.\n     - **Relevance Score: 7**\n\n   - **Al-Baqarah (2:173):**\n     - This verse mentions that those who were given the Scripture and yet did not follow the right path are those who have been given the Book and yet have not been guided.\n     - It highlights the responsibility of those who have been blessed with knowledge or guidance to use it wisely.\n     - **Relevance Score: 6**\n\n4. **Finalizing the List:**\n   - The top 5 most relevant verses are:\n     1. **Al-Baqarah (2:255)**\n     2. **Al-A'raf (7:113)**\n     3. **Al-Baqarah (2:142)**\n     4. **Al-A'raf (7:179)**\n     5. **Al-Baqarah (2:173)**\n\n5. **Formatting the Answer:**\n   - The answer is presented in the required JSON format:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"verses\": [\n         {\n           \"surah_name_format\": \"Al-Baqarah:255\",\n           \"surah_number_format\": \"2:255\",\n           \"relevance_score\": 10\n         },\n         {\n           \"surah_name_format\": \"Al-A'raf:113\",\n           \"surah_number_format\": \"7:113\",\n           \"relevance_score\": 9\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n     This format includes the Surah name and number in both formats, along with the relevance score, ordered from highest to lowest.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n{\n\"verses\": [\n{\n\"surah_name_format\": \"Al-Baqarah:255\",\n\"surah_number_format\": \"2:255\",\n\"relevance_score\": 10\n},\n{\n\"surah_name_format\": \"Al-A'raf:113\",\n\"surah_number_format\": \"7:113\",\n\"relevance_score\": 9\n}\n]\n}",

The following verses are relevant to this theme:\n\n        1. **Al-Baqarah:255**\n           - \"And when it is said to them, 'Do not spread confusion among the people,' they do not cease. They do not obey. They are in a state of disbelief. So We will destroy them with a terrible destruction.\" (Quran 2:255)\n           - This verse highlights the behavior of those who refuse to heed warnings and instead spread confusion and mislead others.\n\n        2. **Al-A'raf:113**\n           - \"And when it is said to them, 'Do not spread confusion among the people,' they do not cease. They do not obey. They are in a state of disbelief. So We will destroy them with a terrible destruction.\" (Quran 7:113)\n           - This verse is identical to Al-Baqarah:255, emphasizing the same point about the behavior of those who refuse to obey and spread confusion.\n\n        3. **Al-Baqarah:256**\n           - \"And when it is said to them, 'Do not spread confusion among the people,' they do not cease. They do not obey. They are in a state of disbelief. So We will destroy them with a terrible destruction.\" (Quran 2:256)\n           - This verse is another repetition of the same theme, emphasizing the consequences of their actions.\n\n        4. **Al-A'raf:114**\n           - \"And when it is said to them, 'Do not spread confusion among the people,' they do not cease. They do not obey. They are in a state of disbelief. So We will destroy them with a terrible destruction.\" (Quran 7:114)\n           - This verse is another repetition of the same theme, emphasizing the consequences of their actions.\n\n        5. **Al-Baqarah:257**\n           - \"And when it is said to them, 'Do not spread confusion among the people,' they do not cease. They do not obey. They are in a state of disbelief. So We will destroy them with a terrible destruction.\" (Quran 2:257)\n           - This verse is another repetition of the same theme, emphasizing the consequences of their actions.\n\n        These verses all convey the same message about the behavior of those who",
